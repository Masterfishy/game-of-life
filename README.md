# Game of Life
My Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

I originally wanted to try and implement the Game of Life in Golang, but found that I wanted to spend time making my implementation fast.  To do that, I decided I wanted to make use of Python's Numpy library for the fast matrix operations.

## Run the Game of Life
As long as you have Numpy installed simply run:
```
python conwaygol.py
```
